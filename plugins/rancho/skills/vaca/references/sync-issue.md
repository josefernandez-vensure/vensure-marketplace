# Sync — Post Progress to an Issue

> Part of the **Sync** phase. Read `conventions.md` first for the frontmatter
> schemas, path standards, and datetime rule — they apply here unchanged.
> Run the Repository Safety Check in `sync.md` before any GitHub write.

**Trigger**: User wants to sync local development progress to a GitHub issue as a comment.

### Preflight
- Verify issue exists: `gh issue view <N> --json state`
- Check `.claude/epics/*/updates/<N>/` exists with a `progress.md` file.
- Check `last_sync` in progress.md — if synced <5 minutes ago, confirm before proceeding.

### Process

Gather updates from `.claude/epics/<epic>/updates/<N>/` (progress.md, notes.md, commits.md).

Format and post a comment:
```bash
gh issue comment <N> --body-file /tmp/update-comment.md
```

Comment format:
```markdown
## 🔄 Progress Update - <date>

### ✅ Completed Work
### 🔄 In Progress
### 📝 Technical Notes
### 📊 Acceptance Criteria Status
### 🚀 Next Steps
### ⚠️ Blockers

---
*Progress: N% | Synced at <timestamp>*
```

After posting: update `last_sync` in progress.md frontmatter, update `updated` in the task file.

Add sync marker to local files to prevent duplicate comments:
```markdown
<!-- SYNCED: <datetime> -->
```
